                <p><span class="firstLetter">O</span>ne day, Mr. Coffee, a well to do coffee bean, was walking home from his highly
                    sophisticated job on Wall Street when he came across a charming dervish of a
                    coffee bean.  This odd coffee bean was smaller and round, unlike Mr. Coffee
                    who was a little bigger with a flat side.  Being a generous and benevolent
                    bean, asked this odd bean if he was OK.  The round bean introduced himself
                    as Mr. Peaberry.  Mr. Peaberry began to talk with Mr. Coffee about his
                    work on Wall Street.  Mr. Coffee was obliged to share his love of work 
                    with his new acquaintance.  However, Mr. Peaberry was not impressed and
                    began to show an air of superiority about all things of which Mr. Coffee spoke.  
                    This began to offend Mr. Coffee and he eagerly looked for a way out of the 
                    conversation.  Mr. Peaberry, either through malice or indifference, began to 
                    talk louder and faster leaving Mr. Coffee no exit from the conversation.  
                    Finally, Mr. Coffee could take no more of the insolent Mr. Peaberry and struck 
                    him while loudly shouting, “Shut up, shut up!”</p>
        
                <p>Some of you may be thinking, wow, what a jerk Mr. Peaberry is to act in such a 
                    manner.  You may also be confused about why Mr. Peaberry would go on and on about 
                    himself.  Thus is the mystery surrounding the (Mr.) Peaberry.</p>

                <p><span class="firstLetter">F</span>irstly, I should state something you may already know.  Coffee beans are not 
                    really beans.  They are the seed contained in the pit of a fruit that is very 
                    similar to a cherry.  In fact, it is called a cherry.  If you already knew this, 
                    I apologize.  If you didn’t, well, you are now smarter, which is usually a good 
                    thing, right?</p>
            
                <p>You may have heard of peaberry coffee before.  Tanzania peaberry is a common 
                    one, although in the past few years I have heard of more and more peaberry 
                    coffees.  Most of these are from Africa, such as Kenya and Rwanda but I have also 
                    seen Papua New Guinea Peaberry.</p>
            
                <p>So what exactly is the big deal about peaberry, because it is a big deal to 
                    some people. (Take the example above where Mr. Peaberry just went on and on about 
                    how awesome he was compared to Mr. Coffee.)  Well, to some people peaberry is just 
                    a misconception perpetuated by some elite coffee geeks.  To others it is the 
                    epitome of the very essence of coffee.  Ultimately, like most things, it is purely 
                    a matter of opinion.</p>

            <p><span class="firstLetter">P</span>eaberry coffee is just as much a defect of the plant as it is a pristine 
                example of that plant.  What happens is when a coffee cherry grows, the inside 
                of the pit is separated into two twin seeds.  These seeds are crammed into one 
                small space.  As they grow they are sort of smashed together creating a flat 
                side on each ‘bean’ where they touch in the middle.  This is what we will call 
                normal coffee progress.  In normal coffee progress, the plant sends nutrients 
                evenly to each of the seeds.  Each of the two seeds ends up pretty much the same 
                with half of what the coffee plant has to offer.</p>

                <p>Occasionally in the development of a coffee cherry there will be some 
                screw-up.  It may be a genetic issue where the cherry only has one seed 
                develop and the other is defective or simply missing.  It could be from some
                sort of physical issue where one side is damaged.  Whatever the reason, only one 
                seed will develop in the cherry.  This one, lonely seed would be like the only 
                child of affluent parents.  This seed would get every scrap of nutrient that the 
                parent cherry had to give.  Thus, it is said, the single cherry would be more 
                flavorful.  All the sugars and flavors and nutrients that would normally be split 
                between two seeds would be all in this one lonely, some might say holy, bean.  
                And since there is only one seed growing in this now spacious luxury condo, the 
                bean has all the room it needs to grow nice and round.  But since this is not 
                its normal growing parameters it doesn’t just grow double the size, it still has 
                its genetic code that determines such things.  Think of it like a mother with 
                twins.  The twins are usually a little smaller at birth than a single baby would 
                be, but the single baby is not twice the size of one of the twins just because 
                it is the only one there.</p>

            <p>Historically, this was a preferred bean.  Back in the early days of coffee 
                roasting you would roast your coffee in a skillet on your stove or campfire.  
                If you had a bunch of the more common beans with a flat side in a flat skillet 
                you can imagine how it might be difficult to stir these evenly.  The flat side 
                would want to be down against the flat surface of the skillet and you would 
                end up with scorching.  If all of your beans were round then they would roll 
                and stir more evenly and you would get a more even roast.  With modern drum 
                roasters this is not nearly as odd a problem but there are still issues with 
                flat sides of beans and flat sides of roasters.  It is also noteworthy that 
                some people thought that a peaberry was a defect and they were intentionally 
                picked out and discarded.</p>

            <p><span class="firstLetter">N</span>ow if you remember back to the beginning I had said this is all subjective. 
                (I actually said objective but that was so long ago that we don’t really remember 
                who said what now do we?)  So some of you with super tasters and above average 
                tasters will probably be able to taste a difference.  Some of you may not.  
                Taste is the most important thing when it comes to the consumer of coffee and 
                everyone has different likes and dislikes leading to difference of opinion 
                about peaberry coffee.</p>
        
            <p>To make matters even worse for the convolution of the mystery of the peaberry 
                greatness, this is something that only happens about 2-5% of the time depending 
                on the varietal.  There is not a specific plant that grows only peaberry as far 
                as I know.  The peaberry has to be manually removed from the general population 
                of coffee beans.  This takes time.  Time is money.  "Peaberry is money" would 
                be the logical conclusion.  And this is the fuel of the mystery fire.  Some 
                people like to believe that just because it costs more it is better.  In coffee 
                this is generally true.  But if you don’t have a highly developed pallet, and 
                this is a genetic thing not a sophistication thing, you may never be able to 
                determine the difference.</p>
        
            <p>Now you know that the peaberry is a sort of super coffee bean.  It has all 
                this extra goodness and flavor and love and hope and dreams that is normally 
                split between two beans.  But, despite all this, some people think that this 
                is all a bunch of hooey. Some people think that the only reason that peaberry 
                is better than other coffee beans is that it has been hand picked.  Extra 
                special care has gone into picking out the peaberry from the regular beans 
                and therefore the defect beans are discarded.  They think that if this 
                particular attention was paid to normal coffee then the end result would be 
                just the same. </p>
        
            <p>So what does this mean?  It means that if you have never tried peaberry 
                coffee, you should.  You may be missing out on the best coffee you have 
                ever had.  But then again, it just may taste like any other coffee you 
                have ever had in your life.  Who knows.</p>
